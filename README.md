# cuda-exercises-HPC

## repo overview:
This project contains labs of my University HPC class.

## Lab overview:
### [*Lab 1*]("Lab%201") : 
#### Optimization for serial code 

### [*Lab 2*](/Lab%202) : 
#### This piece of code implements a separable convolution of a 2D image with an arbitrary filter, using CUDA.

### [*Lab 3*](/Lab%203) : 
#### Same as lab 2 but the multiplication is being performed with a tiled silution, using CUDA.

### [*Lab 4*](/Lab%204) : 
#### Image proccessing: Sharpen an MRI image by using Histogram Equalization and parallel programming with CUDA
