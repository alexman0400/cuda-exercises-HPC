# cuda-exercises-HPC

## repo overview:
This project contains labs of my University HPC class.

## Lab overview:
### [*Lab 1*](Lab 1) : 
#### Optimization for serial code 

### [*Lab 2*](Lab 2) : 
#### This piece of code implements a separable convolution of a 2D image with an arbitrary filter, using CUDA.

### [*Lab 3*](Lab 3) : 
#### Same as lab 2 but the multiplication is being performed with a tiled silution, using CUDA.

### [*Lab 4*](Lab 4) : 
#### Image proccessing: Sharpen an MRI image by using Histogram Equalization and parallel programming with CUDA
